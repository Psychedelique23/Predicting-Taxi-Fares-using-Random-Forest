# Predicting Taxi Fares using Random Forest

In this project, I with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013. I use regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time. 
The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, which was originally obtained and published by Chris Whong.
